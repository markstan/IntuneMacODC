# IntuneMacODC
IntuneMacODC (Intune MacOS One Data Collector) is a support tool to gather system information and logs from MacOS devices managed by Intune.

Run these commands in Terminal to download the script, mark it executable, and launch this tool:

     curl -L https://aka.ms/IntuneMacODC -o IntuneMacODC.sh
     chmod u+x ./IntuneMacODC.sh
     sudo ./IntuneMacODC.sh

When the script completes, a zip file named IntuneMacODC.zip will be created in an ODC sub-folder.  A Finder window will launch to show the contents of the folder.
